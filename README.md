# Algorithm-Practice

This repository contains my iterations on some algorithmic problems I have been working on. I will continue to update this as I work on more and more of them. This readme will also contain the conceptual ideas behind each algorithm if possible.

# Collatz Conjecture

  In this program the user inputted number must be greater than one. Each iteration of the program checks if that number is even or odd. If the number is even, it divides that number by two. If the number is odd, it multiplies the number by 3 and adds 1. The program will run until the output number reaches 1, at which point the program will tell you how many times it ran and produce a line  graph of each number in the sequence using matplotlib.
